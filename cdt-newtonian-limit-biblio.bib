	abstract = {A static situation of two objects held apart by a strut is considered within the framework of general relativity, and the gravitational attraction between the objects is inferred from the stress in the strut. In the Newtonian limit -- the objects are well separated and the field weak everywhere except in their immediate vicinity -- Newton's law of gravitation is reproduced. This check goes well beyond verifications of the Newtonian limit based on considerations of "test particles", since arbitrarily strong self-fields are not excluded for either object. It is also an explicit verification of the equality of active and passive gravitational masses.},

	abstract = {The dynamical generation of a four-dimensional classical universe from nothing but fundamental quantum excitations at the Planck scale is a long-standing challenge to theoretical physicists. A candidate theory of quantum gravity which achieves this goal without invoking exotic ingredients or excessive fine-tuning is based on the nonperturbative and background-independent technique of Causal Dynamical Triangulations. We demonstrate in detail how in this approach a macroscopic de Sitter universe, accompanied by small quantum fluctuations, emerges from the full gravitational path integral, and how the effective action determining its dynamics can be reconstructed uniquely from Monte Carlo data. We also provide evidence that it may be possible to penetrate to the {sub-Planckian} regime, where the Planck length is large compared to the lattice spacing of the underlying regularization of geometry.},

	abstract = {Causal dynamical triangulations {(CDT)} constitute a background independent, nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity, in which the gravitational path integral is approximated by the weighted sum over causally well-behaving simplicial manifolds i.e. causal triangulations. This thesis is an analysis of the data from the Monte Carlo computer simulations of {CDT} in 3+1 dimensions. It is confirmed here that there exist the semiclassical limit of {CDT} for so-called (4,1) (or equivalent (1,4)) simplices, being a discrete version of the mini-superspace model. Next, the form of the corresponding discrete action is investigated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the effective, semiclassical solution works also after the inclusion of remaining (3,2) and (2,3) simplices, treated collectively. A specific form of the resulting extended discrete action is examined and a transition from the broader framework to the former narrower one is shown.},
